When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 A remote repository can be accessed from anywhere or any computer, making collaboration and accessing lost files much easier.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 You would have less control over when and what is pulled from your remote repository.
